# Species-Distrubtion-Models


Participants - Cameron Jones and Eric Hanson
Cal Poly Humboldt, Bioinformatics

brief: The purpose of this tutorial is to make the full extent of spcies distubtions using occurances as well as raster files to determine which abotic factors lead to a preable environment. With this models we can better understand the species range as well as make preductions based on future abotic predictions.
