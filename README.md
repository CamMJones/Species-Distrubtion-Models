# Species-Distrubtion-Models

Participants - Cameron Jones and Eric Hanson

Cal Poly Humboldt, Bioinformatics

## Brief
The purpose of this tutorial is to make the full extent of species distributions using occurrences as well as raster files to determine which abiotic factors lead to a preferable environment. With these models we can better understand the species range as well as make predictions based on future abiotic predictions.
